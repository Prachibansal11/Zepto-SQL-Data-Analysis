## Objective:
This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto ‚Äî one of India‚Äôs fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.
# Zepto E-commerce Inventory Analysis

üìå **Project Overview**  
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

- ‚úÖ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database  
- ‚úÖ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies  
- ‚úÖ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees  
- ‚úÖ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue, and more

üìÅ **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and originally scraped from Zepto‚Äôs official product listings. It mimics what you‚Äôd typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility ‚Äì exactly how real catalog data looks.

**üßæ Columns:**

| Column               | Description                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| sku_id               | Unique identifier for each product entry (Primary Key)      |
| name                 | Product name as it appears on the app                        |
| category             | Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.       |
| mrp                  | Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ‚Çπ)  |
| discountPercent      | Discount applied on MRP                                      |
| discountedSellingPrice| Final price after discount (also converted to ‚Çπ)            |
| availableQuantity    | Units available in inventory                                 |
| weightInGms          | Product weight in grams                                      |
| outOfStock           | Boolean flag indicating stock availability                   |
| quantity             | Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce) |

üîß **Project Workflow**

### 1. Database & Table Creation  
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
